# Resume Parser

A Python-based resume parsing tool that extracts structured information from PDF resumes. 
Currently uses **spaCy** (NLP) + **regex** for parsing, with planned LLM integration for improved accuracy.

---

## Features

- üìÑ **PDF to Text** conversion using `pdfplumber`
- üîç **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** via spaCy for detecting companies, job titles, and locations
- üóÇ **Categorization** into work, education, certification, and projects
- üõ† **Skill Extraction** from predefined keyword lists
- üìä **Structured JSON Output** with timeline and summary
- üß† **LLM Integration (coming soon)** for better accuracy on unstructured resumes

## Example Output

```json
{
  "timeline": [
    {
      "year": "2024",
      "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
      "company": "Tech Corp",
      "type": "work",
      "description": "Brief description of role and achievements",
      "details": [
        "Key responsibility or achievement 1",

      "location": "City, Country"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalExperience": "5 years",
    "currentRole": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "keySkills": ["React", "Node.js", "Python"],
    "education": "Bachelor's in Computer Science"
  }
}
